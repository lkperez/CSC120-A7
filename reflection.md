Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the methods moveIn and moveOut in the House class by changing the type of parameter from String to Int because sometimes all we care about is the number of people who move in or move out rather than their specific names. In library I tried to overload isAvailable by changing the parameter from int to string as well. So you can also see the amount of books that are available.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I tried building off of code that wasn't working in the first place cause I thought I could still do the assignment without worrying about that. But once I fixed my code it made everything much easier to understand. I could also clearly see what errors I needed to focus on. Advice I would give is to take a breather from writing code cause when coming back to it you would have sort of a reset and things within your code would become much clearer.
